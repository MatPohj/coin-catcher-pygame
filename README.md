# coin-catcher-pygame
My pygame for the Part 14 of "Python Programming MOOC, Advanced Course in Programming 2025" In the game your goal is to pick up as many coins as possible. There will also be targets that are not supposed to be picked. The game ends if you miss a coin or you pick a wrong target
